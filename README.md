## Overview
This project is a prototype AI-enabled tool for **managing and reconciling genomic annotation differences** between Ensembl releases and across **GRCh37 and GRCh38 genome builds**.  
It introduces a reproducible way to track annotation version changes while applying **AI-based conflict resolution** to handle discrepancies.

The tool currently provides both:
- A **command-line utility** for direct analysis
- A **web interface** for simple demonstrations

## Why I Built This
I developed this project independently as a **high school student**, motivated by the challenges of comparing annotations between genome builds.  
My aim is to create a framework that is practical for researchers, while also learning from the expertise of the genomics community, the combination of the two culminating in my passion for both the fields of genomics and bioinformatics and working on this project.  

I am sharing this with leading researchers to request **feedback, suggestions, and critique**.  
Your input will directly shape the direction and rigor of future releases.

## Features
- AI-powered conflict resolution for annotation updates  
- Automated version tracking across Ensembl releases  
- Interconversion between **GRCh37** and **GRCh38** reference assemblies  
- Transparent, reproducible change logs  

## Limitations
- Currently a **prototype (v1.0.0)**, intended for evaluation rather than production  
- Benchmarking on large, diverse datasets is ongoing  
- Feedback on edge cases (e.g., overlapping transcripts, complex gene models) is especially welcome
